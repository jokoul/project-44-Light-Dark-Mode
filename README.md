# project-44-Light-Dark-Mode

## Description
This is a demo website design to show light and Dark mode feature made with javascript. This functionality allows users to use toggle button to switch the color of the website. To achieve that, I applied DRY principle on custom function that I created to change dynamically class attribute and css style by using setAttribute and classList method.
